# Five Crowns
Five Crowns is a card game played by 2 players. 


# The Objective
The objective of this game is to score the fewest points after all the rounds. 

# The Players
Two players play this game - one player will be the human user of your program, and the other player will be your program/computer. 

# The Setup
Two 58-card decks are used. Each deck contains:

    five suites: spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts and tridents.
    eleven cards in each suit: 3 through 10, Jack, Queen and King. Note no Ace, 1 or 2 cards.
    three jokers. 

The values of the cards are as follows:

    Cards 3-10 are worth their face value.
    Jack is worth 11 points, Queen is 12 and King is 13.
    Joker is worth 50 points.
    Each round has a wild card. The wild card of a round is the card with the face value equal to the number of cards dealt in the round, e.g., in a round where players are dealt 7 cards each, 7 is the wild card. The wild card is worth 20 points. 

# A Round
A round proceeds as follows:

    The two decks are shuffled together.
    Each player is dealt n cards. On the first round, n = 3. On the next round, n = 4, and so on. On the last round, n = 13.
        For each round, the wild card is the card with the value of n. 
    The remaining cards are placed in draw pile face down. The top card in the draw pile is removed from the draw pile and placed face up in discard pile.
    First player:
        On the first round, a coin is tossed to determine who plays first. Human player is asked to call the toss.
        On subsequent rounds, the player to go out first on the previous round plays first. 
    The two players take alternate turns thereafter till the round ends.
    The round ends when one player goes out and the other player plays a turn to earn points. 

# A Turn
During her/his turn, a player plays as follows:

    Draws the top card from the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile.
    Tries to assemble the cards in hand as runs and books:
        A run is a sequence of three or more cards of the same suit, e.g., 5, 6 and 7 of diamonds.
        A book is three or more cards of the same value, e.g., 9 of clubs, clubs and tridents. 
    Each card can be part of only one book or run.

    Jokers and wild cards make it easier to assemble runs and books:
        A joker can stand in for any card in a run or book, e.g., a run can be 5 of diamonds, a joker standing for 6 of diamonds and 7 of diamonds.
        A wild card can stand in for any card in a run or book, e.g., on the first round when the wild card is 3, a book can be 9 of clubs, 3 of any suit and 9 of tridents. 
    The player can have any number of wild cards and jokers in a run or book, and they can be anywhere in a run. A Joker or wild card can be moved from one book/run to another between turns, e.g., a Joker used as part of a 3-4-5 run on turn 1 can be re-purposed to be part of a 7-7-7 book on the next turn if the player picks up a 3, 4 or 5 card during turn 1.
    Discard one card on to the discard pile.
    If all the remaining cards in the player's hand can be arranged in runs and/or books, the player will go out by displaying the runs and books.
    If the other player has just gone out, the player will display all the runs and books in her/his hand. The sum of the values of the remaining cards in the player's hand will be the points awarded to the player. 

# A Game
A game consists of 11 rounds:

    In the first round, each player is dealt 3 cards and the wild card is 3.
    In each subsequent round, the number of cards dealt to the players and therefore, the wild card increases by 1.
    In the last round, the cards dealt to each player is 13, and the wild card is King (13). 

## Score
A player's score is the sum of the points earned by the player on all 11 rounds. Note that a player who goes out first in a round earns 0 points. The winner of the game is the player with the lowest score. 

# Computer Player's Strategy
Your computer player must play to win. It must have a strategy for each of the following:

    Whether to draw from the draw pile or discard pile;
    Which card to discard on the discard pile on each turn;
    How to use jokers and wild cards;
    When to go out.
